# dotnet-core-raspberry-pi

I have created a Wiki page [here](https://github.com/challe/dotnet-core-raspberry-pi/wiki/Setting-up-a-Web-API-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-3-(Ubuntu-16.04)-using-.NET-Core-2.x-(and-1.x)) that describes how to set up .NET Core on your Raspberry Pi. This currently works using both 1.x and 2.x compatible versions! 

Feel free to create issues if you have a question, and I will expand the wiki.
